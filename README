application does not process params from command line
for query 1, pass author's email to method getPaperDetailByAuthor 
for query 2, pass paper id and review recommendation to getReviewsByPaper
for query 3, just call getCountSubmittedPaper, it will count all papers from table paper
for query 4, first generate a random email as author id by genRandomAuthorId
pass author info and paper info to submitPaper
for query 5, pass the first author's id in table author to removeAuthor
